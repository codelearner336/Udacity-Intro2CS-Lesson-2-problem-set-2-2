This repository contains programs that are solutions to  Lesson 2 extra-exercises in Udacity Intro to CS class

Program:
Define a procedure, stamps, which takes as its input a positive integer in  pence and returns the number of 5p, 2p and 1p stamps (p is pence) required   to make up that value. The return value should be a tuple of three numbers  (that is, your return statement should be followed by the number of 5p, the number of 2p, and the nuber of 1p stamps). The answer should use as few total stamps as possible by first using as  many 5p stamps as possible, then 2 pence stamps and finally 1p stamps as  needed to make up the total. 

Program:
Define a procedure to find the range of a set of three number (range = highest-lowest)

Program: take two strings as input. Check if all the characters in the second string exist in the frist string. Note character order is not importante eg if string one is abcd and string two is dc, then the answer is True.
